New_message = '''The "electrical resistance" of an electrical conductor is a measure of the difficulty to pass an electric current through that conductor.
The inverse quantity is electrical conductance, and is the ease with which an electric current passes.
Electrical resistance shares some conceptual parallels with the notion of mechanical friction.
The SI unit of electrical resistance is the "ohm" (Î©), while electrical conductance is measured in siemens (S)'''
