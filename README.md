# Python Storage
This repository contains all my Python codes.
## Process to Install Python on VS code.
The following [page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_create-a-virtual-environment) explains how to install Python on VS code on different operation systems.
## Git Credentials.
When Git requests your credentials, it uses:
* User.name: Jose Luis Figueroa de Lara
* Password: Personal Access Token (Notion)

The private repositories should be configured with a Personal Access Token. The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FugonDV6RdE&t=156s) explains how to do it.
### Important notes.
1. The Python interpreter used on my Ubuntu machine is Python 3.10.12, as the newest interpreter does not work (Python 10.12.3).
